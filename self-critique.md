What we did well:
We organized our roles well: while everyone helped out with almost everything, each of us had a primary domain of mastery, such as handling Carina or making good SQL query templates. We all rose to the occasion when things came up: we would come in on short notice and work for as long as we had to.

What we learned:
We learned how to coordinate and collaborate more often: the longer the project went on, the better we got at telling each other about things and working together in a group. We also learned a lot about each of the tools implemented, especially MySQL since we used raw queries to accomplish several things including search and pagination.

What we could've done better:
We could’ve made better use of the github issue tracker: most of us just focused on our assigned portions without making or closing issues in a timely manner. While we ended up learning a little bit of everything, Carina is the one thing most of us still do not understand. Had we all gotten a better grasp of it, we would've been more flexible in deploying and testing the deployment. In the first part we overlooked empty files and didn’t make static pages: This would've been been remedied by better communication and finer attention to detail, as well as better time management as we finished part 1 VERY close to the deadline.

What still puzzles us:
Carina. It is both puzzling to use and puzzling as to why it was a good choice of host for this project. All throughout the project, new, almost inexplicable errors would occur and it was very hard to keep track of what was going on.
