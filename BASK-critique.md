Pop-up modals for errors are cool

(We wouldâ€™ve done well to also implement error visibility)

Search is functional but the results have only one column

Data is incomplete (Only 4 states)

Pagination is unusual: No limit on number of pages at bottom

Google maps is integrated for states and cities but not for neighborhoods (just shows world)

Access to their API was spotty
