What they did well:
We really liked the pop-up modals for errors. They do a good job of quickly telling the user what went wrong, which could help a lot for debugging. They also had a nice aesthetic with good navigation and an easy to use search feature.

What we learned:
We wouldâ€™ve done well to also implement improved error visibility. We spent a lot of time pulling up the developer console, which is valuable time when troubleshooting obscure javascript errors.

What they can do better:
Search results could've had more than one column of data. Their data is not comprehensive (only 4 states). Their Google maps integration works for states and cities, but is pointless on the neighborhoods pages. Lastly, access to their API was very spotty, making it difficult to integrate into our own website.

What puzzles us:
Their pagination is quite unusual: there's no limit on number of pages at bottom. If they had comprehensive data for all states, this would've meant hundreds of clickable numbers at the bottom of the central neighborhoods page.
